# Interactive Brokers Web API / Client Portal API

- Authenticate to the API
  Run `bin/run.sh root/conf.yaml` from `/ibkr`

Authentication must be done through a browser without a VPN, preferrably Chrome

Must have Java installed (aka run from Java container...That can also automate the login process with a headless browser...)
